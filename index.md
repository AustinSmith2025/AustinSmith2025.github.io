# Austin Smith's Portfolio


Hello there! I am a Criminal Justice Major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in Fall 2025. A little background of me is that I was born in Vietnam and lived there for 14 years I was playing basketball back then and then I moved here 8 years ago to play basketball. I went to Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California and was on the Varsity team in 2019-2020. I unfortunately had a bad accident where I broke my wrist in 2020 and I discontinued playing basketball on a sports team after that incidient. In my college planning phase during my senior year of high school, I was very interested in the TV show Criminal Minds and I wanted to learn how criminals think, what is their gain, why they do crime in order to be arrested and put in jail or prison and how can we help the criminal. I picked basketball up again back in 2021 but casually play it from time to time. In 2022 I had a major jaw surgery that put me back a semester. Recently, I got engaged in summer and planned to be married in 2026. I also have been looking into cybersecurity and I also want to have a backup if I happen not to like the Criminal Justice Field and want to do something else. I also have no prior knowledge to coding prior to this semester. Where I will see myself in 5 years time is that I will be a Police Officer and having a place to me and my wife and if have I have the time, enjoy my video games and enjoy watching movies.


## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


* Lab 2


 I liked lab 2 because it went back and forth with std::cin and std::cout. I found it interesting that std::string was used to initialize singular_noun, plural_noun, and present_test_verb. I learned from this lab that std::string can be used on multiple different occasions for initializing std::string.


* Lab 4 Part 1


 I liked lab 4 part 1 because it introduced 2 sources, the functions, and the main source code, and I liked how it organized into two separate sources, meaning the main code and the code of the function. I liked how everything was done by typing in a couple of digits to get the milliliters to teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups. I learned how to use divide in arthritic operators in the source of the function and get the numbers for what the test wanted.


* Lab 7


 I liked lab 7 because it was the first time we had to use images to code details of parking hours. I found coding tricky and messed up a couple of times with the if statements. Still, after several attempts, I figured it out and realized I was using arithmetic operators and not Boolean expressions. I then cleared it up in the functions, and everything worked out. In this lab, I learned to use Boolean expressions.
